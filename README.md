# Polar Spirals, Ulam Spirals, and Annotated Ulam Spirals

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files for generating polar spirals, Ulam spirals, and annotated Ulam spirals. These notebooks can be used to visualize number sequences and patterns, useful for research and educational purposes.

## Notebooks

### Polar Spirals
- `polar_spiral.ipynb`: Generates polar spiral plots from given numbers.

### Ulam Spirals
- `ulam_spiral.ipynb`: Generates Ulam spiral plots from given numbers.

### Annotated Ulam Spirals
- `annotated_ulam_spiral.ipynb`: Generates annotated Ulam spiral plots from given numbers.

## Resources

The `resources` folder contains Jupyter Notebook files containing code cells and explanations of the algorithms and concepts used in the scripts.

## Images

The `images` folder contains images used in research papers or presentations related to the generated plots.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/Utsav-2301/sphenic.git

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

4. Open the desired notebook file (`polar_spiral.ipynb`, `ulam_spiral.ipynb`, or `annotated_ulam_spiral.ipynb`).

5. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code cells and generate the plots.
